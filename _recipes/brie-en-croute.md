<p class="pill">Serves 4 – 6</p>

## Ingredients

- 1 TBSP butter
- 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
- 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
- 1 wheel Brie, 8 oz
- 1 egg, beaten
- crackers, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375° .
2. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Sauté the walnuts in the butter until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the cinnamon and brown sugar and stir until walnuts are coated well.
4. Lay the puff pastry out on a flat surface. Place the brie in the center of the pastry. Place the walnut mixture on top of the Brie. Gather up the edges of the pastry , pressing around the brie and gather at the top. Gently squeeze together the excess dough. Brush the outside of the dough with the beaten egg .
5. Place Brie on a cookie sheet and bake until pastry is golden brown , about 20 minutes .

## Notes

- Try different combinations of mixtures on top of the brie. If you have trouble with the puff pastry staying together, dip your hands in water and then squeeze together the top or tie the top closed with kitchen twine. You do not have to brush the outside with the egg, but that is what gives this the nice golden brown color.
