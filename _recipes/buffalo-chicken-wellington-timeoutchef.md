## Ingredients

- 1 (17.3-ounce / 2-sheet) box frozen puff pastry, thawed  
- 1/3 cup hot sauce, plus more for serving  
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
- 6 cooked, breaded chicken cutlets (about 1¼ lb)  
- 1 (4-ounce) container crumbled blue cheese  
- 1 pound part-skim mozzarella, sliced (8 slices)  
- 1 large egg, beaten  
- Ranch dressing, for serving  
- Carrot sticks and celery sticks, for serving  

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to **425°F**. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Place one puff pastry sheet on the parchment and top with the second sheet. Roll into a **17 × 13-inch** rectangle.
3. In a small bowl, mix the hot sauce and melted butter. Brush both sides of the chicken cutlets with the buffalo sauce.
4. Brush remaining buffalo sauce over the pastry, leaving a **1-inch border** along one long side and both short sides.
5. Sprinkle blue cheese evenly over the pastry. Layer **4 slices mozzarella**, **3 chicken cutlets**, then remaining mozzarella and chicken.
6. Brush the exposed pastry edges with egg wash. Fold the pastry over the filling to fully enclose, tucking in the sides. Turn seam-side down.
7. Brush the top with egg wash and cut **three vents** in the top.
8. Bake for **45–50 minutes**, until deep golden brown and crisp.
9. Rest for **5 minutes**, slice, and serve with ranch dressing, carrots, celery, and extra hot sauce.

## Notes

- Can be assembled up to **2 hours ahead** and refrigerated before baking.
- For less breading, substitute plain cooked chicken cutlets.
- Great for slicing into smaller portions for parties.
