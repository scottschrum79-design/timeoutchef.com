## Notes

- Fresh ingredients always taste best , but I am all about using what we have on hand and not having to spend a lot . For example , the frozen peas can be replaced with shelled fresh peas, and the lemon juice can be replaced with the zest of a lemon and the juice of 1 fresh squeezed lemon.
