## Ingredients

- 1 cup (2 sticks) salted butter, softened  
- 1 ½ cups packed brown sugar  
- ½ cup granulated sugar  
- 2 large eggs  
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract  
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour  
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt  
- 1 teaspoon baking powder  
- ½ teaspoon baking soda  
- 1 ½ cups oats (quick or old-fashioned)  
- 1 cup chocolate-coated candies (such as M&M’s)  
- ¾ cup chocolate chips (milk or semi-sweet)  
- ½ cup chopped pecans  
- 2 ¼ cups crispy rice cereal  

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.  
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.  
3. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla.  
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.  
5. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.  
6. Fold in the oats, M&M’s, chocolate chips, and pecans. Gently fold in the rice cereal last.  
7. Scoop dough into large balls (about 3–4 tablespoons each) and place on prepared baking sheets.  
8. Chill the dough for 30 minutes to help the cookies hold their shape.  
9. Bake for about 20 minutes, until golden around the edges but still soft in the center.  
10. Cool on a wire rack and serve with cold milk.

## Notes

- These cookies are meant to be big and chewy — avoid overbaking.  
- Mix-ins are flexible: swap pecans for peanuts or add peanut butter chips.  
- Dough freezes well for future baking.
