## Ingredients

### Cake Layers

-   24 graham crackers
-   2 (3.4 oz) packages vanilla instant pudding mix
-   2 1/3 cups cold milk
-   12 oz whipped topping (1.5 tubs), thawed

### Chocolate Ganache Topping

-   12 oz semi-sweet chocolate bars or chips (chopped if using bars)
-   1 1/2 cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1.  **Layer graham crackers**\
    In a 13x9-inch glass dish, arrange a single layer of graham
    crackers, breaking as needed to cover the bottom.

2.  **Prepare pudding mixture**\
    In a large bowl, whisk together pudding mix and cold milk until
    smooth. Fold in whipped topping until fully combined.

3.  **Build layers**\
    Spread half of the pudding mixture over the graham crackers.\
    Add another layer of graham crackers.\
    Spread remaining pudding mixture on top.\
    Finish with a final layer of graham crackers.\
    Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

4.  **Make ganache**\
    Place chocolate in a heat-safe bowl.\
    Heat heavy cream in a saucepan over medium-low for about 5 minutes,
    until just beginning to boil (not a rolling boil).\
    Pour hot cream over chocolate. Let sit 2 minutes, then whisk until
    smooth.

5.  **Top the cake**\
    Remove cake from refrigerator. Pour ganache evenly over top and
    smooth with a spatula.

6.  **Chill**\
    Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours before serving (overnight
    preferred).

## Notes

-   Overnight chilling gives the best cake-like texture.
-   Chocolate chips melt well; if using bars, chop finely.
-   Wipe knife between slices for clean cuts.
