- 1 cucumber, peeled and chopped

1. In a medium bowl, stir together the cucumber , garlic and jalapeno . Stir in some olive oil and lemon juice , about 1 spoonful of each. Salt and pepper to taste.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Soften each tortilla in the skillet for about 30 seconds on each side , or until warm and pliable . Place the tortillas on a work surface and spread each with 2 spoonful s of refried beans ; sprinkle each with cheese . Roll up the tortillas to resemble cigars.
3. Using the same skillet, pour in enough oil to just cover the bottom of the pan over medium high heat. Working in batches , fry the taquitos, turning until crisp and browned, about 3 to 5 minutes , may have to add more oil between batches . Drain on paper towels.
4. Serve the taquitos with a spoonful of sour cream and a helping of the cucumber salsa.

## Notes

- You can make a chicken version of this recipe by replacing half of the refried bean mixture with cooked chicken, approx 2 breasts.
