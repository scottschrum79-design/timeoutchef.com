<p class="pill">Serves 4 – 8</p>

## Ingredients

- 1 gallon vegetable oil
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 cup flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded, diced
- 1 (8.5 oz) can cream -style corn
- 1/2 onion , finely chopped
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 4 TBSP cornstarch
- 8 hot dogs

## Directions

1. Fill a deep fryer or large heavy pot with the oil and heat to 375 degrees .
2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal , flour , baking powder , baking soda , cayenne pepper , and a punch of salt and pepper .
3. In a separate bowl, combine the jalapeno , corn , onion , and milk .
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients all at once , and stir only enough times to bring the batter together; there should be lumps. Set batter aside and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
5. Scatter the cornstarch into a dry pie pan. Roll each hot dog in the cornstarch and tap well to remove any excess.
6. Trans fer enough batter to almost fill a large drinking glass.
7. Refill the glass as needed. Place each hot dog on chopsticks , and quickly dip in and out of the batter. Immediately and carefully place each hot dog into the oil, and cook until coating is golden bro wn, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove to cooling rack, and allow to drain , about 3 to 5 minutes.
8. Serve with mustard.

## Notes

- The oil can be reused for frying several times if cooking similar items. For example corn dogs and on ion rings. Do not mix fish with other products. Buttermilk provides a better flavor than milk, but unless you are going to be doing a lot of frying in the near future, stick to the regular milk, since butter milk does not have a desirable flavor by itself.
