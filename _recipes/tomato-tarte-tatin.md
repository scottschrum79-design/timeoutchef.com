1. Preheat oven to 425° .

Peel tomatoes. Cut out cores, halve lengthwise, and remove seeds.
3. Spread butter over bottom of 8” to 10” cast iron skillet , or another oven safe skillet . Sprinkle sugar over butter. Arrange tomato halves, rounded side down and close together, in concentric circles in skillet to fill completely.
4. Place skillet over medium heat. Cook until sugar and butter are reduced to thic kly bubbling, deep amber syrup , moving tomatoes occasionally to prevent burning, about 25 minutes.
5. Remove skillet from heat. Immediately drizzle vanilla over tomatoes. Top with pastry round. Using a knife, tuck in edges of pastry. Cut 2 or 3 small slits in top of pastry. Place skillet in oven and bake tart until pastry is deep golden brown, about 25 minutes.
