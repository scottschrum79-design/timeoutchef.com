<p class="pill">Serves 4</p>

## Ingredients

- 4 skinless, boneless, chicken
- breasts
- flour
- 4 oz prosciutto, pancetta, or
- bacon, chopped
- 8 oz crimini, porcini, or shitake
- mushrooms, sliced
- 1/2 cup marsala wine
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 2 TBSP butter
- Cilantro, chopped, handful

## Directions

1. Place chicken breasts in zip lock bag or cover with plastic wrap and pound flat with mallet or rolling pin. Put some flour in a shallow platter and season with a punch of salt and peppe r; mix with a fork to distribute evenly.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium -high heat and add enough oil to cover bottom. Dredge both sides of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess. Slip the cutlets into the pan and cook for 5 minutes on each side until golden, turning once. Remove the chicken and keep warm. Do not discard drippings in pan.
3. Using the same skillet lower the heat to medium and add the prosciutto to the drippings, sauté for 1 minute to render out some of the fat, longer if using pancetta or bacon . Now, add the mushrooms and sauté until they are nicely browned and their moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add the marsala to the pan and cook for a minute to remove alcohol. Add the chicken stock and simmer for several minutes to reduce the sauce. Stir in the butter and return the chicken to the pan; simmer until chicken is heated through, approx 1 minute.
4. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with chopped cilantro .

## Notes

- To avoid being splattered with oil start by slipping in the chicken closet to you and then slowly lowering into pan away from you.
