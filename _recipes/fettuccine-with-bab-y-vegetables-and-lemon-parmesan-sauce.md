## Notes

- You do not have to use both zucchini and squash, but the combination adds more color to the dish. Likewise you do not have to use a combination of regular and spinach fettuccine. Also, if you do not have a lemon just use several spoonfuls of lemon juice an d skip adding the zest. If you are using fresh green beans make sure you trim them.
