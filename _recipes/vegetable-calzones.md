<p class="pill">Serves 4</p>

## Ingredients

- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 package yeast
- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 cup whole -wheat flour
- 1 tsp . salt
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella
- 3/4 cup ricotta
- 3 scallions, chopped
- 2 TBSP basil, chopped
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 2 plum tomatoes, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, diced

## Directions

1. Combine 3/4 cup of warm water and sugar in a small bowl.
2. Sprinkle in the yeast and let stand until foamy.
3. Combine the flours and salt. Mix in the yeast mixture and the egg. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.
4. Pour a little olive oil in the bottom of a mediu m bowl . Form the dough into a ball and roll it around in the bowl till it is coated on all sides by the oil. C over it in the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until it doubles, about an hour or two, in a warm draft free place, or overnight in the refrigerator.
5. In a medium sized bowl c ombine the mozzarella , ricotta , scallions , basil , and a pinch of salt and pepper .
6. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
7. Punch down the dough. Cut the down into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a circle. Spread the cheese evenly , on half of each dough , leaving some room around the edge . Top the cheese with the tomatoes and green peppers . Fold dough over and crimp the edges to seal. Transfer calzones to baking sheet and make three slashes on top of each calzone. Bake until the calzone is a nice golden -brown, about 20-25 minutes.

## Notes

- The warm water should be between 110 and 120 degr ees. If the water is too hot it will kill the yeast and if it is too cold they will not become active. The tomatoes and bell pepper can be replaced with your favorite i ngredients or for added fun, let everyone choose their own type of calzone. The dough is best if made a day ahead and allowed to rise in the refrigerator. You can also use store bought fresh dough, I like Bertucci’s, instead of making it yourself .
