5. Grill burgers until heated through, about 3 minutes per side.

## Notes

- None of the ingredients need to be cooked in this recipe; all you are doing is heating up the black bean burgers.
- You may want to toast the buns and/or use whole wheat buns.
- I find barbeque sauce balances the burgers the best as a topping.
