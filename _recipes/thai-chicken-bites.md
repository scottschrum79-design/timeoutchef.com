- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 TBSP chili garlic sauce
- 1 TBSP lime juice
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp ginger , grated

- 1 cucumber, sliced into 1/4" thick

- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar

## Directions

1. Heat a medium skillet to medium -high heat. Add the ground chicken and cook until fully done, approx 10 minutes. Drain and let cool.
2. In a medium bowl, stir together the oil, chili sauce , lime juice , sugar and ginger until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the chicken to coat. Stir in half of the peanuts , the mint and cilantro .
3. Top each cucumber round with one spoonful of the chicken mixture. Sprinkle the rounds with the remaining peanuts.
4. In a small saucepan heat the vinegar under medium heat until reduced by half, approx 5 – 10 minutes. Let cool and drizzle chicken bites with balsamic reduction.

## Notes

- The balsamic reduction should be a thick like syrup and you cannot tell until it has cooled. If it does not appear thick enough after cooling reduce again under the heat and let cool again. Repeat until you achieve the desired consistency.
