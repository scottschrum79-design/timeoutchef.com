title: "Raspberries with Ricotta Cream"
---

<p class="pill">Serves 4</p>

## Ingredients

- 1 cup part -skim ricotta cheese
- 2 TBSP light brown sugar
- 2 TBSP orange liqueur
- 1 pint raspberries
- Mint sprigs

## Directions

1. Place the ricotta in a small strainer set over a bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes to drain the excess liquid.
2. Transfer the drained ricotta to a food processor or blender, add the brown sugar and orange liqueur and process until smooth. (The ricotta mixture can be made up to 8 hours in advance and covered and kept refrigerated.) Divide the ricotta mixture among 4 dessert bowls and top each with the raspberries . Add a splash of the orange liqueur, and garnish with mint sprigs .

## Notes

- If you do not have orange liqueur you can use orange juice instead. If you do not have a strainer a coffee filter works just as well. You can experiment with this recipe adjusting the type of liqueur you use and fruit.
