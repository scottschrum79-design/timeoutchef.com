- 5 cups chicken broth
- 4 TBSP butter
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 3 garlic clove s, finely chopped
- 6 oz sausage , casings removed
- 2 cups Arborio rice (risotto rice)
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 3/4 cup Parmesan, grated

## Directions

1. Blanche greens in boiling water just until wilted, about 1 minute. Drain. Pour greens back into pot and fill with cold water. Drain again and set aside Fill a sauce pan with the chicken stock . Bring to a boil then turn down the heat and keep at a simmer throughout the cooking process.
2. Meanwhile melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat; add onion and garlic . Sauté until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sausage ; sauté until brown, breaking up with spoon, about 3 minutes. Add rice; stir 1 minute. Add wine; reduce heat to medium -low. Simmer until wine is almost absorbed.
3. Add the heated broth several ladles at a time, to the rice. Stir until broth is almost absorbed. Repeat this process until rice is tender and most of the broth is gone , about 25 minutes .
4. Remove from heat. Mix in cheese and greens. Season to taste with salt and pepper .

## Notes

- You want the chicken stock to be simmering because the rice will absorb it quicker. Also, you probably will not use all of the broth, but it is better to have a little too much than too little. Instead of buying a can of broth you can add several bouillon cubes to 5 cups of water. The base of all risotto is the same just replace the sausage and greens with your favorite ingredients.
