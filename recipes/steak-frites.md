3. Fill a large skillet with enough oil , preferably a vegetable oil, to reach a depth of 1/2" and place over high heat . Fry the potatoes until golden, about 5 minutes , may have to do in several batches depending on size of p an; transfer to the paper towels to drain. Season with salt and pepper to taste Meanwhile, heat a cast-iron skillet, large enough to fit the steak, over medium -high heat . Season the steak with salt and pepper on both sides . Add the remaining butter and a swirl of oil to the pan. Once the butter stops foaming, add the steak and cook, turning once, until browned, about 8 minutes for medium -rare. Transfer to a cutting board, tent loosely with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before thinly slicing acros s the grain.
4. Serve sliced steak topped with a chunk of the herb butter, alongside of the fries with the mayo dipping sauce

## Notes

- You want to fry the potatoes with a vegetable oil and not olive oil because olive oil burns at a lower temperature. To get a nice French fry cut from the potatoes a mandolin works best and well worth the investment. You want to let the meat rest so it reabsorbs the juices and your meat is not dry and bloody.
