---

<p class="pill">Serves 4</p>

## Ingredients

- 4 garlic cloves
- 2” ginger, peeled, chopped finely
- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1 to 1½ lb pork tenderloin
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3/4 lb tomatoes, large dice
- 1 peach, chopped
- 2 tsp thyme , chopped
- 1 tsp sugar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F with rack in middle.
2. In a small food processor (coffee grinder, magic bullet, etc…) combine the garlic , ginger , curry powder, a pinch of salt and pepper . Blend to a paste. Rub all over pork .
3. Heat a large ovenproof skillet , about 12”, over medium -high heat and add a swirl of oil. Brown pork on one side, about 5 minutes, then turn over and transfer skillet to oven. Roast until an instant -read thermometer inserted in to thickest part of meat registers 145 to 150°F , about 10 to 12 minutes. Let pork rest, uncovered, on a cutting board while making compote. Do not discard drippings.
4. Add onion to skillet with pork drippings (handle will be very hot) and sauté over medium -high heat until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomatoes and peach and sauté until just softened, 3 t o 4 minutes. Stir in thyme and sugar .
5. Slice pork and serve with compote.

## Notes

- If you do not have a small food processor you can mash the ingredients by hand with a mortar and pestle or large metal spoon and bowl. Never slice meat immediately after cooking. It needs to cool several minutes to reabsorb the juice inside it.
