<p class="pill">Serves 4</p>

## Ingredients

- 8 corn tortillas, cut into ¼” thick
- strips
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1 large red onion, diced
- 2 large tomatoes , diced
- 2 jalapenos, seeded, minced
- ½ oven roasted chicken,
- shredded
- 1 bag frozen corn, about 4 cups
- 1 TBSP lime juice
- 1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped
- 1 ripe avocado, peeled and
- cubed
- 8 oz feta, crumbled

## Directions

1. Heat a large skillet over high heat and cover the bottom of the pan with vegetable oil. Cook the tortilla strips , in batches, until golden brown and then remove from the pan and drain on paper towels, about 1 minute . Set aside Heat a stock pot to medium -high heat and add a swirl of olive oil. Add the garlic , onion , tomatoes , and jalapenos to pot and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chicken broth to the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, stir in the shredded chicken , corn , and lime juice . Bring the pot back about to a boil and then reduce to a simmer for about 5 minutes more to blend flavors. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
2. To serve, divide the soup among bowls. Top each bowl with some of the fried tortilla strips you set aside, avocad o cubes, crumbled feta, and cilantro .

## Notes

- With the other half of the roasted chicken, save for another recipe, I usually use it to make chicken salad if I do not eat it all while making the soup. If you do not want to buy an oven roasted chicken it is about 1 ½ lbs of cooked chicken. Also I will b uy the chicken roaster myself and cook it to save myself some money. If you want a smokier flavor use dried chipotles instead of jalapenos . Or, if you want a richer flavor use ancho chilis . If corn is in season replace the frozen corn with two ears of gril led corn. If you want to make this a little healthier instead of frying the tortilla strips bake them in the oven.
