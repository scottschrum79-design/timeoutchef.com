## Ingredients

- Dressing
- 1/4 cup dried cranberries
- 3 TBSP red wine vinegar
- 2 TBSP balsamic vinegar
- 1 TBSP dijon mustard
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp pepper
- 1/3 cup olive oil

- Rehydrate the cranberries in a small bowl of hot water for
- about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.

## Directions

1. In a blender combine the hydrated cranberries, red wine vinegar , balsamic vinegar , mustard , salt, and pepper . Blend until smooth. Continue to run the blender and slowly add the oil to the mixture until it thickens and is emulsified.
2. Salad Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
3. Arrange the chopped walnuts on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake in oven until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.
4. In a large bowl, combine the toasted walnuts, dried cranberries , mixed greens , apples , and blue cheese . Add the vinaigrette and toss to coat.

## Notes

- An emulsion is when fat bonds to water. If you pour the oil in too fast the oil and vinegar will not blend and the dressing will be ruined. If the dressing is too thick add some more red wine vinegar and if it is too thi n add some oil. If you do not want to bother with the dressing just buy your favorite dressing instead, but preferably a fruity vinaigrette
