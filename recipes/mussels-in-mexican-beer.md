## Notes

- If you do not have beer you can use either chicken or fish stock, 6 oz (3/4 cup). Also, most store bought mussels do not have beards so do not worry about removing their beards.
- You can add to this recipe and do lots of variations. Try it with some cooked potatoes, sausage, and/ or rosemary. Or serve this over pasta. The longer the mussels are in cold saltwater, the less likely there will be any grit in your meal.
